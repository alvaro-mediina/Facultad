## Chapter 1: Introduction
### The Problem Domain

### The Software Engineering Challenges

### Summary
    1. The problem domain for software engineering is industrial strength software. 

    2. Software engineering problem domain This software is not just a set of computer programs but **comprises programs** and associated **data** and **documentation**.

    Industrial strength software is expensive and difficult to build, expensive to maintain due to changes and rework, and has high quahty requirements.

    3. Software engineering is the discipline t h a t aims to provide methods and procedures for systematically developing industrial strength software. Thee main driving forces for software engineering are the problem of scale, quality and productivity (Q&P), consistency, and change. Achieving high Q & P consistently for problems whose scale may be large and where changes may happen continuously is the main challenge of software engineering.

    4. The fundamental approach of software engineering to achieve the objectives is to separate the development process from the products. Software engineering focuses on process since the quality of products developed and the productivity achieved are heavily influenced by the process used. To meet the software engineering challenges, this development process is a phased process. Another key approach used in Software Engineering for achieving high Q&P is to manage the process effectively and proactively using metrics.
